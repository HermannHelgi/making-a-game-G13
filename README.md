#### This repository represents the source code for a Bsc. final project at the Reykjav√≠k University.
#### This project was created by a team of 5 over the course of 15 weeks. 
#### Cold Bargain is a game created using the Unity 6 game engine. The game is a winter horror survival and exploration game. The core concept of the game is surviving the cold unforgiving environment all the while being actively hunted by a terrible monster. This you do with the help of the illusive witch in the wall, who offers you the possibility of bargaining with her for different items that you may need to survive.
